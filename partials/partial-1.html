            <h2>Article-1 The Value Of Money</h2>
            <img src="images/Money.jpg" alt="Image of money">
            <p>The value of money refers to its ability to be exchanged for goods and services, as well as its
                purchasing
                power over time. At its core, money acts as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of
                account,
                facilitating economic transactions and the measurement of wealth.<br><br>

                One critical aspect of money's value is the time value of money (TVM), which posits that a dollar today
                is
                worth more than the same dollar in the future because of its earning potential through interest or
                investment returns. This concept is essential in financial planning and investment decisions, as it
                underscores the importance of considering the opportunity cost of money over time.<br><br>

                Furthermore, money's value is subject to fluctuations due to inflation, which diminishes purchasing
                power,
                and interest rates, which affect its growth potential. These factors highlight the necessity of prudent
                financial management to maintain or enhance the value of money over time.<br><br>

                Ultimately, while money is a crucial tool for meeting our needs and enhancing our quality of life, it is
                important to recognize that it is not an end in itself but a means to achieve personal and financial
                goals.

            <h2>Article-2 GMO Food</h2>
            <img src="images/pexels-thirdman-8940363.jpg" alt="hand of man adding food grains">
            <p>Genetically modified foods (GM foods) are created from organisms whose DNA has been altered using genetic
                engineering techniques. This process allows the introduction of new traits and improved features in
                plants
                and animals, such as increased resistance to pests and diseases, enhanced nutritional content, and
                better
                adaptability to adverse environmental conditions.<br><br>

                The production and consumption of GM foods have raised several concerns and debates. One major issue is
                the
                potential for GMOs to escape into the wild, which could introduce new genes into natural ecosystems,
                potentially disrupting local biodiversity and ecological balance. There are also public health concerns
                about the safety of consuming genetically modified organisms, as the long-term effects are not fully
                understood. Critics argue that GM foods could introduce allergens or toxins into the food
                supply.<br><br>

                Despite these concerns, regulatory bodies like the FDA maintain that GMOs currently on the market are
                safe for consumption. GM crops are extensively used in the production of everyday food ingredients
                such as cornstarch, soybean oil, and canola oil.</p>

            <h2>Article-3 The View of World in 2100</h2>
            <img src="images/ai-generated-7443431_1280.jpg" alt="ai generated futuristic city">
            <p>By 2100, the world is expected to undergo significant changes due to technological advancements,
                population
                growth, and environmental challenges. The global population is projected to reach around 11 billion,
                increasing demand for resources and urban space. Technological marvels, including advancements in
                artificial
                intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology, will significantly reshape industries and day-to-day life,
                with
                potential applications in healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing.<br><br>

                Climate change remains a critical concern. Although the Earth will still be habitable, extreme weather
                conditions and rising sea levels may force significant adaptations in agriculture, housing, and energy
                production. Sustainable practices and renewable energy sources are expected to be essential in
                mitigating
                these impacts.<br><br>

                Societally, the world could see a shift in global power dynamics, with changes in the political
                landscape and the potential for new alliances and conflicts. Life in 2100 could range from a utopian
                society driven by innovation and sustainability to a dystopian reality grappling with resource
                scarcity and technological disparities.</p>
